  "critical_issue": "tl.multiple_of is called on 2D pointer tensors (a_ptrs, b_ptrs) with scalar 16, causing a shape/values length mismatch during compilation.",
  "why_it_matters": "Triton expects the length of values passed to multiple_of to match the tensor rank; mismatch raises the observed ValueError and aborts autotuning/compilation.",
  "minimal_fix_hint": "Remove these multiple_of calls or pass a list of alignment values matching a_ptrs/b_ptrs dimensions instead of scalar 16."

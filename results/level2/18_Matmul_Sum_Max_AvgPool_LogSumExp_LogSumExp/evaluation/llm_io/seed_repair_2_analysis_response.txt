  "critical_issue": "The Triton path replaces the full reduction chain with a plain sum over linear outputs, omitting the two logsumexp (and other) nonlinear operations.",
  "why_it_matters": "Max, mean, and especially logsumexp are nonlinear; dropping them changes the mathematical function, so the fused kernel computes a different output than the PyTorch reference.",
  "minimal_fix_hint": "Incorporate the max/mean/logsumexp steps into the Triton implementation instead of reducing everything to a simple summed linear output."

  "critical_issue": "ModelNew’s parameters don’t match the reference nn.Linear module’s structure, so its weights/biases are never aligned with the original model.",
  "why_it_matters": "The comparison uses completely different randomly initialized parameters for ModelNew, causing large numerical discrepancies unrelated to the Triton kernel’s math.",
  "minimal_fix_hint": "Make ModelNew contain an nn.Linear submodule named `linear` (matching Model) so weight/bias keys and shapes align for state_dict loading."

You are optimizing a Triton kernel based on algorithmic analysis.

**CRITICAL**: Study the PyTorch code carefully to understand:
- What does `forward()` return? (full output sequence vs final hidden state only)
- What is the computational pattern?
- What are the input/output shapes?

Your optimized kernel MUST match this exact behavior.

# Analysis Results

**Bottleneck**: In `fused_linear_chain`, `w_reduced = weight.sum(dim=0)` and `b_reduced = bias.sum()` are recomputed on every forward pass, launching extra kernels and reading the full (out_features, in_features) weight matrix each time, even when parameters are unchanged.

**Optimization Strategy**: Algorithm replacement via parameter reparameterization/caching: precompute and cache `W_reduced` and `b_reduced` as model buffers (or as the actual trainable parameters) and update them only when the underlying weights change, so each forward becomes a single matvec with already-collapsed parameters.

**Implementation Plan**: Introduce cached buffers `w_reduced` and `b_reduced` in `ModelNew`, initialized from `weight` and `bias`. During training, update these buffers once per optimizer step (e.g., via a hook or explicit `update_reduced_params()` call) by summing over the out_features dimension; in `forward`, remove the per-call reductions and use only the cached `w_reduced`/`b_reduced` in the Triton matvec kernel. For inference with frozen weights, compute the reduced parameters once at model initialization or after loading the checkpoint and reuse them for all subsequent forwards.

**Expected Speedup**: 20-40%

# Your Task

Implement the optimization strategy above. Focus on the specific bottleneck identified.

## Key Requirements

1. **Preserve correctness**: Maintain the same input/output behavior
2. **Apply the optimization**: Follow the implementation plan exactly
3. **Use valid Triton syntax**:
   - Every kernel MUST have `@triton.jit` decorator
   - Grid size MUST be > 0: use `triton.cdiv(N, BLOCK)` or `max(1, N // BLOCK)`
   - BLOCK sizes MUST be power-of-2: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256
   - No `continue`, `break`, `return` inside kernels (use masking)
   - Prefer `tl.dot(a, b, allow_tf32=True)` for matmul operations

4. **CRITICAL for RNN/GRU/LSTM Persistent Kernels**:
   - Time loop MUST be inside @triton.jit kernel, NOT in Python forward()
   - **HYBRID computation strategy** (CRITICAL for performance):
     * Precompute input-side gates OUTSIDE kernel: `gates_x = (T*B, In) @ W_ih` (ONE large GEMM)
     * INSIDE kernel: only recurrent-side: `for t: gates_h = h @ W_hh` (T small GEMMs)
   - CORRECT (FAST - use this):
     ```python
     # Python forward():
     gates_x_all = x.reshape(T*B, In) @ W_ih + b_ih  # ONE large GEMM
     gates_x_all = gates_x_all.view(T, B, 3*H)
     gru_persistent_kernel[grid](gates_x_all, h0, W_hh, ...)  # Launch ONCE

     @triton.jit
     def gru_persistent_kernel(gates_x_ptr, h_ptr, W_hh_ptr, ...):
         for t in range(T):  # Inside kernel
             gates_x_t = tl.load(gates_x_ptr + t*...)  # Precomputed
             gates_h = h @ W_hh  # Only recurrent GEMM
             h = (1-z)*n + z*h   # Fuse and update
     ```

5. **Output format**:
   - Imports: `import torch, torch.nn as nn, triton, triton.language as tl`
   - `@triton.jit` kernel(s)
   - Wrapper function(s)
   - `class ModelNew(nn.Module)` — REQUIRED
   - NO testing code, NO `if __name__ == "__main__"`

  "worth_optimizing": "yes",
  "reason": "The fused Triton kernel is ~18% slower than the PyTorch baseline, indicating that the custom convolution algorithm is underperforming relative to cuDNN while providing only modest fusion benefits.",
  "bottleneck": "The kernel reimplements a full direct convolution in Triton, which is unlikely to match cuDNN’s highly tuned conv2d, so most runtime is spent in a slower convolution while the extra fusion of Mish+Mish does not compensate for this deficit.",
  "optimisation method": "Replace the current all-in-one Triton conv+Mish kernel with a hybrid approach: use PyTorch’s/cuDNN’s conv2d for the convolution, and add a separate Triton kernel that fuses the two Mish activations into a single pointwise pass computing mish(mish(x)).",
  "modification plan": "In ModelNew.forward, first call torch.nn.functional.conv2d(x, self.weight, self.bias, stride=1, padding=0, dilation=1, groups=1) to obtain the convolution output using cuDNN. Then launch a simple Triton kernel over the output tensor that performs mish(mish(x)) in one pass (optionally using efficient intrinsics like tl.softplus + tl.tanh), writing in-place or to a new tensor. Remove the convolution loops and indexing logic from the Triton kernel, keeping it purely as an optimized fused-activation kernel after conv2d.",
  "expected_speedup": "30-40% vs the current Triton kernel (and likely modestly faster than the PyTorch baseline by eliminating one of the two Mish kernel passes and an extra memory round-trip)."

  "critical_issue": "Launch grid size ignores GROUP_M while pid mapping assumes grouped tiles, so many output tiles are never executed and remain uninitialized.",
  "why_it_matters": "Uninitialized regions of c contain arbitrary data or NaNs; comparing against the PyTorch reference yields NaN absolute errors and large mismatches, triggering the 'Outputs are not close' failure.",
  "minimal_fix_hint": "Adjust grid() to account for GROUP_M so the number of launched programs covers all (pid_m, pid_n) tiles; every output element must be written once."

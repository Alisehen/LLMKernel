{
  "worth_optimizing": "yes",
  "reason": "Each forward call does a full `weight.t().contiguous()` on a 32768x32768 matrix, which is an enormous extra memory movement and dominates runtime.",
  "bottleneck": "The kernel is fed with a transposed-and-repacked copy of the weight on every forward; transposing a ~4.3 GB weight matrix (read + write) per iteration is a massive bandwidth cost completely absent from the PyTorch baseline, on top of a slower-than-cuBLAS GEMM.",
  "optimisation method": "Eliminate the per-forward transpose by storing the weight parameter directly in the [K, N] layout expected by the Triton kernel (or precomputing and persisting the transposed form), so the matmul can use the weight without any layout conversion at runtime.",
  "modification plan": "Redefine `ModelNew.weight` to have shape `[in_features, out_features]` (or maintain a persistent transposed buffer) and initialize it accordingly, then update `fused_linear_swish_scale` to pass this tensor directly as `b_ptr` without calling `weight.t().contiguous()`. Adjust the kernel’s B strides (`stride_bk`, `stride_bn`) to match the new layout; no other algorithmic changes are needed.",
  "expected_speedup": "25-35%"

  "critical_issue": "Misuse of tl.max_contiguous: it is called on 2D pointer tensors (a_ptrs, b_ptrs) with a scalar BLOCK_K, causing a shape mismatch.",
  "why_it_matters": "tl.max_contiguous expects input and values with compatible shapes; passing a 2D tensor and a scalar violates this, triggering the compilation-time ValueError seen in the log.",
  "minimal_fix_hint": "Remove these tl.max_contiguous calls, or apply tl.max_contiguous to 1D index tensors (e.g., offs_k) with matching value shapes instead of pointer matrices."

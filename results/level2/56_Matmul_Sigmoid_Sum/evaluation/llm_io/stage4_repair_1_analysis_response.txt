  "critical_issue": "Misuse of tl.multiple_of() on offs_m/offs_n/offs_k, which are not multiples of BLOCK_* per lane, violating Triton’s alignment assumption.",
  "why_it_matters": "multiple_of is an assumption, not a hint; using it on non-multiple indices can cause miscompilation and arbitrarily incorrect loads/computation, leading to large numerical discrepancies.",
  "minimal_fix_hint": "Remove tl.multiple_of on offs_* or apply it only to true-aligned quantities like strides or base pointers, not varying index vectors."

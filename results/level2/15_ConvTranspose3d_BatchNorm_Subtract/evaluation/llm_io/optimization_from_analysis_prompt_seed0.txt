You are optimizing a Triton kernel based on algorithmic analysis.

# PyTorch Reference (Target Behavior)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    A 3D convolutional transpose layer followed by Batch Normalization and subtraction.
    """
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding, bias=True):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.conv_transpose = nn.ConvTranspose3d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride=stride, padding=padding, bias=bias)
        self.batch_norm = nn.BatchNorm3d(out_channels)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv_transpose(x)
        x = self.batch_norm(x)
        x = x - torch.mean(x, dim=(2, 3, 4), keepdim=True)  # Subtract mean along spatial dimensions
        return x

batch_size = 16
in_channels = 16
out_channels = 32
depth, height, width = 16, 32, 32
kernel_size = 3
stride = 2
padding = 1

def get_inputs():
    return [torch.rand(batch_size, in_channels, depth, height, width)]

def get_init_inputs():
    return [in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding]
```

**CRITICAL**: Study the PyTorch code carefully to understand:
- What does `forward()` return? (full output sequence vs final hidden state only)
- What is the computational pattern?
- What are the input/output shapes?

Your optimized kernel MUST match this exact behavior.

# Analysis Results

**Bottleneck**: In bn3d_reduce_kernel, each channel is processed by a single program that loops serially over all N batches and all S=D×H×W spatial positions, so only C programs are launched and the large N×S domain is not parallelized across warps/SMs. This turns what should be a massively parallel reduction into a mostly serial loop per channel, making the reduction kernel significantly slower than cuDNN/PyTorch BatchNorm’s optimized parallel reduction.

**Optimization Strategy**: Replace the current per-channel serial reduction with a parallel multi-block reduction over N×S, where many programs collaboratively compute partial sums/partial sums-of-squares for each channel and then combine them via a second small reduction or atomics. This is an algorithmic change in the reduction strategy: from '1 block per channel with inner loops over N,S' to 'many blocks over (channel, N×S tiles) with hierarchical reduction'.

**Implementation Plan**: Redesign bn3d_reduce_kernel to launch a 2D or 3D grid, e.g., pid_c over channels and pid_t over tiles of the flattened N×S dimension, so each (pid_c, pid_t) processes a small contiguous chunk of N×S for one channel and accumulates local sum and sum of squares. Write these partial results into a temporary [C, num_tiles] buffer, then run a second tiny Triton kernel (or reuse the same kernel with a different grid) to reduce the per-channel partials into final mean/var. This eliminates the long inner loops over N and S per program, greatly increases occupancy, and allows memory loads to be better coalesced and overlapped across many warps.

**Expected Speedup**: 20-40% end-to-end, with a substantially larger speedup (2-5x) on the reduction phase itself depending on N, C, and S.

# Your Task

Implement the optimization strategy above. Focus on the specific bottleneck identified.

## Key Requirements

1. **Preserve correctness**: Maintain the same input/output behavior
2. **Apply the optimization**: Follow the implementation plan exactly
3. **Use valid Triton syntax**:
   - Every kernel MUST have `@triton.jit` decorator
   - Grid size MUST be > 0: use `triton.cdiv(N, BLOCK)` or `max(1, N // BLOCK)`
   - BLOCK sizes MUST be power-of-2: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256
   - No `continue`, `break`, `return` inside kernels (use masking)
   - Prefer `tl.dot(a, b, allow_tf32=True)` for matmul operations

4. **CRITICAL for RNN/GRU/LSTM Persistent Kernels**:
   - Time loop MUST be inside @triton.jit kernel, NOT in Python forward()
   - **HYBRID computation strategy** (CRITICAL for performance):
     * Precompute input-side gates OUTSIDE kernel: `gates_x = (T*B, In) @ W_ih` (ONE large GEMM)
     * INSIDE kernel: only recurrent-side: `for t: gates_h = h @ W_hh` (T small GEMMs)
   - CORRECT (FAST - use this):
     ```python
     # Python forward():
     gates_x_all = x.reshape(T*B, In) @ W_ih + b_ih  # ONE large GEMM
     gates_x_all = gates_x_all.view(T, B, 3*H)
     gru_persistent_kernel[grid](gates_x_all, h0, W_hh, ...)  # Launch ONCE

     @triton.jit
     def gru_persistent_kernel(gates_x_ptr, h_ptr, W_hh_ptr, ...):
         for t in range(T):  # Inside kernel
             gates_x_t = tl.load(gates_x_ptr + t*...)  # Precomputed
             gates_h = h @ W_hh  # Only recurrent GEMM
             h = (1-z)*n + z*h   # Fuse and update
     ```

5. **Output format**:
   - Imports: `import torch, torch.nn as nn, triton, triton.language as tl`
   - `@triton.jit` kernel(s)
   - Wrapper function(s)
   - `class ModelNew(nn.Module)` — REQUIRED
   - NO testing code, NO `if __name__ == "__main__"`

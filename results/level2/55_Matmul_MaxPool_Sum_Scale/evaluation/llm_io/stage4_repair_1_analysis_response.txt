  "critical_issue": "ModelNew defines its own random weight/bias parameters instead of sharing nn.Linear’s parameters, so it doesn’t use the same weights as the reference model.",
  "why_it_matters": "Without matching linear weights and bias, the fused Triton model computes a completely different function from the PyTorch reference, causing huge output discrepancies rather than small numerical differences.",
  "minimal_fix_hint": "Make ModelNew wrap nn.Linear (like Model.matmul) or otherwise use identical weight and bias tensors as the reference model."

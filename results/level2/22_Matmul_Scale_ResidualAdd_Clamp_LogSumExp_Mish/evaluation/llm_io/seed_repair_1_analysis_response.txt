  "critical_issue": "Triton disallows indexing a tensor with a constexpr (lse[0]); lse is a size-1 tensor, and y = lse[0] triggers 'unsupported tensor index: constexpr[0]'.",
  "why_it_matters": "This invalid indexing prevents Triton from lowering the kernel to TTIR, causing compilation to fail before any execution of row_logsumexp_mish_kernel.",
  "minimal_fix_hint": "Avoid size-1 tensors and indexing; keep max_val, sum_exp, lse as scalars (no shape (1,)) and use them directly without [] indexing."

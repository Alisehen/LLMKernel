  "critical_issue": "conv1x1_triton wrongly assumes Conv2d weight is 2D [C_out, C_in] instead of 4D [C_out, C_in, 1, 1].",
  "why_it_matters": "Unpacking weight.shape into two variables fails because shape has four dimensions, raising 'too many values to unpack' before any Triton computation executes.",
  "minimal_fix_hint": "Use the 4D Conv2d weight by reshaping to [C_out, C_in] for 1x1 kernels before passing into conv1x1_triton."

  "critical_issue": "The i2h kernel incorrectly assumes weight_i2h is split into [input_size, hidden_size] instead of a single concatenated weight matrix.",
  "why_it_matters": "This causes incorrect weight indexing for the hidden-to-hidden part, leading to large numerical errors in RNN cell computation.",
  "minimal_fix_hint": "The kernel needs a single weight matrix access pattern that matches PyTorch's concatenated [input+hidden, hidden] weight layout."

  "critical_issue": "tl.multiple_of is applied to 2D pointer tensors (a_ptrs/b_ptrs) with a scalar 16, violating its shape-vs-values requirement.",
  "why_it_matters": "multiple_of expects the length of `values` to match the tensor’s rank; passing a scalar for a 2D tensor triggers the shape mismatch compilation error.",
  "minimal_fix_hint": "Only call multiple_of on 1D/ scalar index or stride tensors, or pass per-dimension values matching the tensor rank, or remove these hints."

  "critical_issue": "The GPU is already almost fully occupied, leaving ~15MB free, so torch.roll’s 20MB allocation in the reference Swin block fails with CUDA OOM before Triton kernels run.",
  "why_it_matters": "This is a capacity issue, not a Triton kernel bug; insufficient free device memory prevents even the baseline PyTorch model from executing, blocking any comparison or benchmarking.",
  "minimal_fix_hint": "Terminate other GPU workloads or reduce model/batch size so several GB of GPU memory are free before running the Swin Transformer benchmarks."

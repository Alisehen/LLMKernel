  "critical_issue": "Reference DenseNet201 forward with batch_size=10 and 224x224 inputs exceeds 23.5GB GPU memory, causing CUDA OOM before Triton kernels run.",
  "why_it_matters": "The benchmark first runs the PyTorch reference model; its large activations and parameters exhaust GPU memory, so even small additional allocations trigger out-of-memory errors.",
  "minimal_fix_hint": "Reduce batch size or input resolution for DenseNet201 in this benchmark, or free GPU memory between runs so total usage stays within device limits."

  "critical_issue": "GRU gate ordering mismatch: kernel expects [z, r, n] but PyTorch weights/linears use [r, z, n], so z and r slices are swapped.",
  "why_it_matters": "Swapped update/reset gates change both candidate computation and hidden-state mixing, so recurrence equations differ from nn.GRU, producing systematic output deviations like the reported 0.73 max_abs_err.",
  "minimal_fix_hint": "Align gate layout with PyTorch: treat linear outputs and weight matrices as [r, z, n], adjusting Triton kernel indexing so z and r use correct slices."

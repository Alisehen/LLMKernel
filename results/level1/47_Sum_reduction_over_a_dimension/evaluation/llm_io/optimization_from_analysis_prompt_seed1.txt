You are optimizing a Triton kernel based on algorithmic analysis.

# PyTorch Reference (Target Behavior)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model(nn.Module):
    """
    Simple model that performs sum reduction over a specified dimension.
    """
    def __init__(self, dim: int):
        """
        Initializes the model with the dimension to reduce over.

        Args:
            dim (int): Dimension to reduce over.
        """
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.dim = dim

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        """
        Applies sum reduction over the specified dimension.

        Args:
            x (torch.Tensor): Input tensor of shape (..., dim, ...).

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: Output tensor after sum reduction, shape (..., 1, ...).
        """
        return torch.sum(x, dim=self.dim, keepdim=True)

batch_size = 128
dim1 = 4096
dim2 = 4095
reduce_dim = 1

def get_inputs():
    x = torch.rand(batch_size, dim1, dim2)
    return [x]

def get_init_inputs():
    return [reduce_dim]
```

**CRITICAL**: Study the PyTorch code carefully to understand:
- What does `forward()` return? (full output sequence vs final hidden state only)
- What is the computational pattern?
- What are the input/output shapes?

Your optimized kernel MUST match this exact behavior.

# Analysis Results

**Bottleneck**: Each output element is computed by a single thread looping over all R=4096 elements, with no parallel reduction across the reduction dimension, leading to poor latency hiding and weaker use of SM resources compared to a hierarchical/tree reduction.

**Optimization Strategy**: Algorithm Replacement: replace the purely per-thread serial reduction over R with a block-level parallel tree reduction, where multiple threads in a block collaboratively reduce chunks of the R dimension using shared memory and warp-level reductions.

**Implementation Plan**: Redesign the kernel so that each program/block is responsible for a tile of (M, N) and splits the R dimension into tiles processed in parallel by threads (e.g., each warp handles a subset of R for a given output). Within each block, load a tile of R into registers/shared memory, perform a parallel intra-block reduction (warp shuffles or shared-memory tree reduce) to produce one partial sum per output, and, if needed, iterate over multiple R-tiles accumulating these partial sums. Finally, write the reduced result to global memory, keeping the same [M,1,N] layout so the Python wrapper stays unchanged.

**Expected Speedup**: 20-30%

# Your Task

Implement the optimization strategy above. Focus on the specific bottleneck identified.

## Key Requirements

1. **Preserve correctness**: Maintain the same input/output behavior
2. **Apply the optimization**: Follow the implementation plan exactly
3. **Use valid Triton syntax**:
   - Every kernel MUST have `@triton.jit` decorator
   - Grid size MUST be > 0: use `triton.cdiv(N, BLOCK)` or `max(1, N // BLOCK)`
   - BLOCK sizes MUST be power-of-2: 16, 32, 64, 128, 256
   - No `continue`, `break`, `return` inside kernels (use masking)
   - Prefer `tl.dot(a, b, allow_tf32=True)` for matmul operations

4. **CRITICAL for RNN/GRU/LSTM Persistent Kernels**:
   - Time loop MUST be inside @triton.jit kernel, NOT in Python forward()
   - **HYBRID computation strategy** (CRITICAL for performance):
     * Precompute input-side gates OUTSIDE kernel: `gates_x = (T*B, In) @ W_ih` (ONE large GEMM)
     * INSIDE kernel: only recurrent-side: `for t: gates_h = h @ W_hh` (T small GEMMs)
   - CORRECT (FAST - use this):
     ```python
     # Python forward():
     gates_x_all = x.reshape(T*B, In) @ W_ih + b_ih  # ONE large GEMM
     gates_x_all = gates_x_all.view(T, B, 3*H)
     gru_persistent_kernel[grid](gates_x_all, h0, W_hh, ...)  # Launch ONCE

     @triton.jit
     def gru_persistent_kernel(gates_x_ptr, h_ptr, W_hh_ptr, ...):
         for t in range(T):  # Inside kernel
             gates_x_t = tl.load(gates_x_ptr + t*...)  # Precomputed
             gates_h = h @ W_hh  # Only recurrent GEMM
             h = (1-z)*n + z*h   # Fuse and update
     ```

5. **Output format**:
   - Imports: `import torch, torch.nn as nn, triton, triton.language as tl`
   - `@triton.jit` kernel(s)
   - Wrapper function(s)
   - `class ModelNew(nn.Module)` — REQUIRED
   - NO testing code, NO `if __name__ == "__main__"`

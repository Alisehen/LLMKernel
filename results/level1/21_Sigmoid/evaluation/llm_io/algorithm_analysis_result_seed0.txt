  "worth_optimizing": "yes",
  "reason": "The Triton kernel is significantly slower than the PyTorch baseline and spends most of its cost in a per-element exp-based sigmoid that can be replaced by a cheaper approximation.",
  "bottleneck": "Each element computes an exact sigmoid via tl.exp, which is relatively expensive and offers more numerical accuracy than typically needed for activations; PyTorch likely uses fast-math/approximated implementations that the current Triton kernel does not match.",
  "optimisation method": "Algorithm Replacement: replace the exact sigmoid formulation (1 / (1 + exp(-x))) with a polynomial or rational sigmoid approximation that avoids exp and uses only additions, multiplications, and possibly abs/min/max, trading a bit of numerical accuracy for significantly lower arithmetic cost.",
  "modification plan": "Implement a new Triton kernel that computes an approximate sigmoid, e.g., a well-known rational/polynomial form like y ≈ 0.5 * (x / (1 + tl.abs(x)) + 1) or a higher-quality fit, ensuring it is branch-free and uses only cheap operations. Calibrate the approximation (e.g., via offline fitting over a reasonable input range) to keep max error within an acceptable bound, then benchmark this approximate kernel against both the current exact Triton sigmoid and torch.sigmoid to verify speed and accuracy trade-offs.",
  "expected_speedup": "20-40%"

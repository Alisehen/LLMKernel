  "worth_optimizing": "yes",
  "reason": "The current Triton tanh implementation uses an expensive exponential-based formulation, making it compute-bound and slower than PyTorch's highly optimized activation.",
  "bottleneck": "The kernel computes tanh via tanh(x) = (e^{2x} - 1)/(e^{2x} + 1), which requires an exp plus several arithmetic ops per element instead of using a cheaper, hardware-optimized approximation; this inflates instruction count and latency for a memory-heavy workload.",
  "optimisation method": "Algorithm replacement: replace the explicit exp-based tanh formula with a fast intrinsic or polynomial/rational tanh approximation (e.g., using `tl.tanh(x)`/libdevice or a short polynomial), reducing math complexity per element.",
  "modification plan": "Inside the Triton kernel, remove the manual computation using `tl.exp` and instead compute `y = tl.tanh(x)` (or an equivalent lightweight approximation implemented as a few fused multiply-adds), keeping the same memory access pattern. Validate numerical accuracy against PyTorch's tanh and adjust approximation degree if needed to balance accuracy vs speed, then re-benchmark against the baseline.",
  "expected_speedup": "30-40% vs the current Triton kernel (bringing it close to or slightly faster than the PyTorch baseline on this workload)"
